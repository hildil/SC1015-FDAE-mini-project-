# SC1015-FDAE-mini-project-

# Background
This is a mini-project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science & Artificial Intelligence) about mental health.
With the concerning rise in mental health issues around the world, we decided to investigate the factors leading to mental health issues. 

## Objective
To create a machine learning model which can predict the level of depression of a person. This would aid in early detection and prevention of mental health issues.

## Problem Statement
How can we make use of the different characteristics present in a user to predict the level of depression they have?

# Methodology

## Data Collection & Cleaning
Initially, we believed social media would have a strong impact on mental health. 
Link to dataset: 

## Exploratory Analysis 
After using visualisation tools such as boxplots, we realised  the correlation between social media and mental health was not as significant. Other factors displayed higher correlation with mental health issues.

## Machine Learning
Using these insights, we decided to use these variables as our predictors.

### Models
1. Numeric Predictor
- Linear & Polynomial Regression
- Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting
- SVR, GAM

2. Categorical Predictor
- Ordinal Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees

3. Multi-Varate Predictors
- Lasso, Elastic Net, Ridge
- Neural Network

# Conclusion
Best performance by Elastic Net Regressor.
Combination of multiple predictor variables was most suitable to predict depression.

Most Relevant Predictors:
- Bothered by worries
- Frequency of interests fluctuating
- Difficulty in concentrating
- Frequency of comparing self to others

We hope that our model would serve to improve the mental health issues plaguing our world through early detection
